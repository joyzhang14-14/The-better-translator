# Discord Translator Bot - Changelog

## v2.3.3 - Fixed Private Main Menu (2025-08-20)

### üîß Critical Bug Fix

### üìã Technical Changes
- **Command Type**: Changed from `@bot.command` to `@bot.tree.command`
- **Parameter Updates**: Changed `ctx` to `interaction: discord.Interaction`
- **Response Method**: Now uses `interaction.response.send_message(..., ephemeral=True)`
- **Message Tracking**: Updated tracking to work with interaction responses
- **Passthrough Commands**: Removed `/bot14` from text command passthrough list
- **Slash Command Sync**: Added automatic slash command synchronization in `setup_hook()`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change
- **Command Usage**: Users now need to use `/bot14` (slash command) instead of `!bot14` (text command)
- **Auto-complete**: Discord will show the command in the auto-complete menu
- **Better UX**: Slash command provides better user experience with descriptions

## v2.3.2 - Private Main Menu (2025-08-20)

### üîí Privacy Enhancement
- **Private Main Menu**: Main menu (!bot14) is now only visible to the command caller (ephemeral)
- **Improved User Experience**: Other users can no longer see the main menu interface, reducing channel clutter
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Bot interactions are now private by default for better user experience

### üîß Technical Changes
- **Ephemeral Response**: Changed from `ctx.reply()` to `ctx.send()` with `ephemeral=True`
- **Message Visibility**: Main menu commands now use Discord's ephemeral message system

## v2.3.1 - Main Menu UX Optimization (2025-08-20)

### üé® User Experience Improvements
- **Main Menu Persistence**: Main menu (!bot14) now stays visible for 10 minutes instead of being deleted by sub-menu operations
- **Independent Timeout**: Main menu has its own 10-minute auto-delete timer, separate from sub-menu interactions
- **Smart Message Management**: Sub-menus only clean up their own popup messages, preserving main navigation
- **Consistent Navigation**: Users can return to main menu options while browsing sub-menus

### üîß Technical Enhancements
- **New Cleanup Function**: Added `_cleanup_popup_only()` to preserve main menu during navigation
- **Timeout Optimization**: Reduced ErrorSelectionView timeout from 10 hours to 10 minutes
- **Auto-Delete Mechanism**: Enhanced `on_timeout()` with automatic message deletion and cleanup
- **Message Reference Tracking**: Improved message lifecycle management for better resource usage

### üõ† Message Management Flow
1. **Main Menu Creation**: `!bot14` clears all old messages and creates new main menu (10-min timer)
2. **Sub-Menu Navigation**: Button clicks preserve main menu, only clear previous popup messages  
3. **Auto Cleanup**: Main menu automatically deletes after 10 minutes of inactivity
4. **Reset Behavior**: New `!bot14` command properly cleans up previous main menu
